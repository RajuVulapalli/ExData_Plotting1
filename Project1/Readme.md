Introduction

This repository is for Project 1 of Data Sciences course Exploratory Data Analysis.

The data set was downloaded from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (detailed in course project 1 description) into a folder in my PC.

If you are going to run the code to validate, please change the folder reference to your pc folder.

The repository has four R files (one for each plot) and four plots as .png files.

The plot1.R file has the code for downloading the file to folder.  Only data for two days is pulled for creating the plot.
